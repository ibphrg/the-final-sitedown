                <h2>The Wanderer from Ul'Dah</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Hydira "Heidi" Vitellus</h3>
            <p>
                Born beneath an ill-fated sky, Hydira walks the lands of Eorzea as both a beacon of hope and a blade of reckoning. An orphaned Au Ra whose tribe was lost to the cruelty of war, she forged her own path in the desert sands of Ul’dah, toiling as a miner’s apprentice before honing her craft as a goldsmith and jeweler. Though her hands shape beauty from the earth’s bounty, they are equally adept at wielding steel against the darkness that plagues the realm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Renowned as a Warrior of Light, she strides where fate demands—her heart unburdened by home yet bound to the people she swears to protect. From the deepest mines to the fiercest battlefields, Hydira endures, a nomad guided by the glint of both precious gems and the unyielding fire of her resolve. Though she bears the weight of loss, she does not let sorrow define her; instead, she carves a future with calloused hands, forging a legacy not of bloodlines, but of the lives she touches and the hope she inspires.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the glow of her forge and the heat of battle, Hydira remains steadfast. Whether shaping delicate filigree from gold or standing against gods and tyrants, she is unwavering—a warrior, an artisan, and above all, a survivor.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Though Hydira is a wanderer, she is no stranger to the art of war. Her journey has led her to master a diverse set of disciplines, each shaping her into the formidable force she is today.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a <span class="bumpUp">Warrior</span>, she embodies the fury of battle, wielding a mighty greataxe with raw, unrelenting power. Her presence on the battlefield is an unshakable force—each swing of her weapon carving a path through enemies, her resilience allowing her to stand against even the fiercest foes. Fueled by sheer will and the echoes of her past, she channels her rage not as mindless destruction, but as a guardian’s unyielding strength, shielding those who cannot protect themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, beneath the steel and fury lies a keen mind. As a <span class="bumpUp">Scholar</span>, Hydira embraces the wisdom of the Nymian healers, weaving aether into protective barriers and restorative magicks. Where her axe cleaves through opposition, her grimoire mends the broken, balancing destruction with preservation. She understands that power is not only in striking down foes but in ensuring that those who stand beside her live to fight another day. With a fairy companion at her side, she commands the battlefield not just with brute strength, but with tactical precision and unwavering support.
            </p>
            <p>
                And when brute force and healing magicks are not the answer, she slips into the shadows as a <span class="bumpUp">Ninja</span>. Swift and deadly, she moves like the night itself, striking before her foes can react. Her mastery of Ninjutsu allows her to bend the elements to her will—lightning crackling from her fingertips, fire erupting at her call, or wind carrying her to safety. Silent, cunning, and efficient, she is a blade in the dark, a whisper of death to those who stand in her way.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bumpUp">Warrior, Scholar, Ninja-</span><br>
                <hr>
                Hydira is all of these and more. Whether standing firm against an onslaught, mending wounds with ancient magicks, or eliminating threats before they even know she’s there, she is the embodiment of adaptability.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Hydira is reliable. A good forefront to the team. Great at leading others through a dungeon, and her skills as a Warrior are unmatched… but sometimes, she scares me- she’s quite vulgar with her language and the smile on her face as she fights... need I say more? She has all my respect because by Nophica’s grace, she has yet to kill me.”</p>
                <p>-Noelle Maletshatsi</p>
